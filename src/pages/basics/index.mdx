### Terms and Definitions

**Controlled Airspace** is such in which two-way radio communication is mandatory for all traffic following IFR (Instrumental Flight Rules) and may be either optional or mandatory for traffic following VFR (Visual Flight Rules) as well. Most controlled airspace has secondary radar coverage.

**Uncontrolled Airspace** is such in which two-way radio communication is not mandatory, however, selective portions may impose radio or transponder requirements through establishment of RMZs (Radio Mandatory Zones) and TMZs (Traffic Mandatory Zones). Uncontrolled airspace most of the time has at least primary radar coverage, but may lack it.

## VATSIM Glossary

### Administrative Structure

**The Board of Governors (BoG)** is the main governing body of the VATSIM Network. All key decisions including, but not limited to financing of the network and enactment of global policies are taken by the BoG.

**Regions** are the primary divisions of the VATSIM Network. They are administered directly by the BoG. Latvia vACC is a part of the **VATSIM Europe, Middle East and Africa (VATEMEA)** region.

**Divisions** are the first layer of self-governance on the Network. They are tasked with working out specific policies and regulations that are applicable for their respective area of the world. Latvia vACC is a part of the **VATSIM Europe Division (VATEUD)** and the vACC Staff Team answers directly to the VATSIM Europe Division Director.

**Subdivisions** are the second layer of self-governance on VATSIM. Some divisions have them and some do not. In divisions where subdivisions are present, they are tasked with managing day-to-day business of a portion of their parent division's airspace. In VATEUD subdivisions are called **virtual Area Control Centres (vACCs)** -- Latvia vACC is a subdivision of the VATSIM Europe Division.

### Transfer and Visiting Controllers Policy

**Transfer and Visiting Controllers Policy (TVCP)** is a global VATSIM policy that governs members' attachments to different entities in the VATSIM administrative structure and their status within them. In this section descriptions are provided to terms used within or relevant to the mentioned policy in the scope of Latvia vACC.

**Active Controllers** are those who are listed on the [Latvia vACC Controller Roster](https://lv-vacc.org/roster) and thus have the privilege to staff ATC positions within EVRR FIR.

**Home Controllers** are VATSIM members whose allocation is `Europe, Middle East and Africa - Europe (except UK) - Latvia`. Those members enjoy the right to full controller training in Latvia vACC. Members can view their current allocation on [my.vatsim.net](https://my.vatsim.net/profile).

**Visiting Controllers** are VATSIM members whose allocation is other than Latvia vACC who are listed on the [Latvia vACC Controller Roster](https://lv-vacc.org/roster) and thus have the privilege to staff ATC positions within EVRR FIR.

### Controller Endorsements

**Unrestricted Endorsement** is one that is granted to a controller at the start of their training. This endorsement gives one the privilege of staffing ATC positions that are not designated as restricted. At the moment, no positions in Latvia vACC are restricted.

**Tier 1 Endorsement** is one that is granted to controllers authorised to control especially complicated ATC positions. At the moment, no positions in Latvia vACC are designated as Tier 1.

**Tier 2 Endorsement** is one that is granted to controllers authorised to control ATC positions that require some kind of special expertise. At the moment, no positions in Latvia vACC are designated as Tier 2.
