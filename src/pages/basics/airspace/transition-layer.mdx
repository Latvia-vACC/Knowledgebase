# Transition Layer

The transition layer is a section of airspace with certain vertical limits within a given portion of the airspace relevant to a certain aerodrome. The transition layer allows to avoid conflicts due to misaligned altimeter settings both below and above the transition layer.

## Altimeters and Barometric Pressure

Most modern aircraft measure their altitude in feet (ft) above mean sea level (AMSL). These measurements are performed using a barometric altimeter - basically an air pressure sensor.
