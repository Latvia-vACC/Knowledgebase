# Airspace Classes

**Airspace differentiation by class** is another way that pilot-ATC interractions are regulated. As evident by the title airspace class is not dependent on the pilots' or controllers' actions, but on the airspace in which a pilot is flying and which ATC is or is not controlling.

Airspace classes are identified by letters A through G. They are spoken on frequency using the international phonetic alphabet. Below is a table explaining the differences between airspace classes.

| Class |     Type     |             Separation Requirements              | Availability to VFR Traffic | Two-way Radio Communications |
| :---: | :----------: | :----------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------: | :--------------------------: |
|   A   |  Controlled  |                   All traffic                    |            ❌ No            |         All traffic          |
|   B   |  Controlled  |                   All traffic                    |   ⚠️ Subject to clearance   |         All traffic          |
|   C   |  Controlled  | IFR from IFR<br />IFR from VFR<br />VFR from IFR |   ⚠️ Subject to clearance   |         All traffic          |
|   D   |  Controlled  |                   IFR from IFR                   |   ⚠️ Subject to clearance   |         All traffic          |
|   E   |  Controlled  |                   IFR from IFR                   |           ✅ Yes            |         IFR traffic          |
|   F   | Uncontrolled |      IFR from IFR<br />as far as practical       |           ✅ Yes            |         IFR traffic          |
|   G   | Uncontrolled |                       NIL                        |           ✅ Yes            |         IFR traffic          |

Nearly all controlled airspace in EVRR FIR is class C with a little exception of Lielvārde CTR, which is class D. All uncontrolled airspace in EVRR FIR is class G.
