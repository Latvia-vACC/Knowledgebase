# EuroScope Extended Guide

This page contains short explainers to some ES functions that are not in day-to-day use of an average ATCO, but are still rather useful. This list is by no means exhaustive since it is the job of vACC ATC Training Department staff to introduce trainees to the use of [required software](/software-guides#required-software); however, if you believe that certain ES features should be covered on this page, feel free to submit feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/Latvia-vACC/Knowledgebase/issues/new?title=Feedback%20for%20%E2%80%9CEuroScope%20Extended%20Guide%E2%80%9D&labels=feedback,enhancement).

## EuroScope Settings

EuroScope configuration and settings are defined separately for each sector file and can be defined through either `.txt` files or EuroScope's UI. The settings files specific to the EVRR FIR sector file can be accessed at `[EVRR FIR Sector File Folder]/EVRR/Settings` and the contents of those folders are as follows.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="EVRR" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="Settings" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="ACC_APP-General.txt" />
      <FileTree.File name="ACC_APP-Tags.txt" />
      <FileTree.File name="Lists.txt" />
      <FileTree.File name="LoginProfiles.txt" />
      <FileTree.File name="Plugins.txt" />
      <FileTree.File name="Screen.txt" />
      <FileTree.File name="Symbology.txt" />
      <FileTree.File name="VoiceChannels.txt" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Due to a rather unique way that ES is built, the `.txt` files contain many more options than can be edited in EuroScope's UI. Normally, there should be no need to edit ES settings directly (i.e. not through a sector file version update), but it is good to know how it is done just in case. In EuroScope's UI settings are available through the `OTHER SET` button on the top green ribbon. The different settings sections largely mean exactly what is written.

While there is no point going over every setting in this guide, an exhaustive description of all ES features is available in [EuroScope Documentation](https://www.euroscope.hu/wp/quick-start/).
