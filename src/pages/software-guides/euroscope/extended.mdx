# EuroScope Extended Guide

This page contains short explainers to some ES functions that are not in day-to-day use of an average ATCO, but are still rather useful. This list is by no means exhaustive since it is the job of vACC ATC Training Department staff to introduce trainees to the use of [required software](/software-guides#required-software); however, if you believe that certain ES features should be covered on this page, feel free to submit feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/Latvia-vACC/Knowledgebase/issues/new?title=Feedback%20for%20%E2%80%9CEuroScope%20Extended%20Guide%E2%80%9D&labels=feedback,enhancement).
