# Introduction

This section of the knowledgebase will be most useful for current or prospective ATCOs looking to control in EVRR FIR. This section is regularly updated with latest additions to software used by Latvia vACC.

<Callout type="error" emoji="⚠️">
  It is the duty of each ATCO to use up to date software provided by the vACC.
  Use of outdated or improperly modified software constitutes lack of currency
  on the controller's behalf.

## Required Software

The following software is required to be installed on a given ATCOs personal computer. The required version is provided next to the name of the software. If a version is not specified, the latest available version is to be assumed as the approved one.

- **EuroScope** (≥ v3.2.3.2) is the primary way of connecting to the network.
- **EVRR FIR Sector File** (AIRAC 2503) is the dataset used within EuroScope to provide ATC services in EVRR FIR.
- **Audio for VATSIM (AFV) client** is the software required to connect to VATSIM voice servers. Any VATSIM-approved client is also approved for use within EVRR FIR, see: [Approved Software for use on the VATSIM Network](https://vatsim.net/docs/policy/approved-software).
- **vATIS** is used to create ATIS connections to the VATSIM Network.

This section of the knowledgebase contains installation guides and user's manuals for the aforementioned software.

## Web Services

In addition to the software above Latvia vACC uses a range of web services to facilitate ATC training, events, and record keeping.

- **[The vACC Website](https://lv-vacc.org)** is the primary medium through which the vACC Staff Team informs the public about upcoming events, significant changes to the vACC structure, and publishes an up-to-date roster of active controllers.
- **[Latvia vACC OneTest](https://training.lv-vacc.org)** is the platform Latvia vACC uses to facilitate ATC training and record keeping. All training requests, training sessions, reports, endorsements, and theory testing is handled through OneTest. ATC bookings and some vACC administrative functions are also performed through said platform.
- **[Latvia vACC Knowledgebase](/)** serves as a "wiki" for all theoretical knowledge, SOPs, and manuals published by Latvia vACC.
- **[VATEUD Core](https://core.vateud.net)** is the administrative medium used for divisional theory testing and record keeping. It is primarily used by the vACC Staff Team, however, it is also used by ATC trainees and VATSIM members in general to handle membership/allocation issues, request visiting endorsements, and pass divisional theory tests.
