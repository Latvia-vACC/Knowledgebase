# Audio for VATSIM Guide

Since 2019 VATSIM has been using a standalone audio transmission protocol called **Audio for VATSIM**. At the moment, there are 3 clients available to use said protocol. The up-to-date list of approved AFV clients is always available in the [Approved Software Policy](https://vatsim.net/docs/policy/approved-software). Lativa vACC recommends the AFV Standalone Client or TrackAudio for use within the EVRR FIR.
