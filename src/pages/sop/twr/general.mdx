  <span className="text-red-500">\*</span> Lielvārde is a military airfield and
  as such is not a training airfield in Latvia vACC. Real life ATCOs at LGS also
  do not go through any training at Lielvārde airbase and are trained
  exclusively at Rīga. Therefore this SOP will exclusively focus on procedures
  followed and phraseology used by Riga Tower.
