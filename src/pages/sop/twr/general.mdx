  <span className="text-red-500">\*</span> Lielvārde is a military airfield and
  as such is not a training airfield in Latvia vACC. Real life ATCOs at LGS also
  do not go through any training at Lielvārde airbase and are trained
  exclusively at Rīga. Therefore this SOP will exclusively focus on procedures
  followed and phraseology used by Riga Tower.

## Responsibility and Required Knowledge

In general, aspiring TWR controllers are questioned and monitored on their ability to the following responsibilities and knowledge points.

### Responsibility

- To select the correct runway-in-use.
- To apply WTC-based separation and issue takeoff and landing clearances.
- To monitor the runway as well as the whole CTR and ensure safe operations.
- To ensure minimum practicable runway occupancy over time.
- To coordinate spacing and departure flow with neighbouring ATS units.
- To provide flight information service (incl. traffic information) to VFR aircraft inside controlled airspace.
- To issue missed approach instructions when needed.
- To accommodate pilots' information and/or procedure requests.
- To observe and enforce local and ICAO rules and regulations for aerodrome movement and runway operations.

### Required Knowledge

- WTC-based departure/arrival spacing rules.
- In-depth understanding of runway operations including application of reduced runway separation minima.
- Tactical application of priority rules.
- Basic understanding of different types of instrumental and non-instrumental approach procedures.
- Ability for multi-directional coordination with neighbouring ATS units.
- Advanced understanding of VFR procedures and FIS provision in controlled airspace.
- Ability to apply and enforce low visibility procedures.
- Ability to execute the duties of TWR and GMC as a combined ATS unit.
- Advanced frequency management ability.
- Phraseology relevant to TWR operations.
