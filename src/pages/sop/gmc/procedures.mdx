# GMC SOP - Procedures

## Basic Procedures

### Selection of Runway-in-use

The duty of selecting the runway-in-use is a joint responsibility of Rīga Tower and Rīga Approach. Should both of those stations be offline, the responsibility is transferred to the highest station online; this includes Rīga Ground, should it be the only station online.

The main method of determining the runway-in-use is based on surface wind. The current METAR always contains that information in the following format: `35011KT`. This contains the direction of the wind (350 degrees in this case) and its speed (11 knots). If the wind direction is closer to 360 degrees (from 270 degrees to 089 degrees), runway 36 shall be selected; otherwise, if the wind direction is closer to 180 degrees (from 090 degrees to 269 degrees), runway 18 shall be selected.

The following factors can be also taken into consideration when selecting the runway in use:

- approach and landing facilities serviceability;
- meteorological conditions (RVR);
- reported or forecast wind shear, or when thunderstorms are expected to affect the approach or departure;
- air traffic flow/direction;
- preferential runway system.

A runway-in-use direction with a tail wind component, including gusts, not exceeding 5 kt can be assigned, when:

- air traffic flow expected to runway direction;
- the crosswind component, including gusts, does not exceed 15 kt and/or;
- the runway condition is not worse than "WET" and braking action is not worse than "GOOD" and;
- braking action is not adversely affected by runway contaminants such as ice, slush, snow, frost and water.

The preferential runway system is applied as follows (time given in Rīga local timezone):

|              | <strong className="font-bold">00:00 to 17:59</strong> | <strong className="font-bold">18:00 to 23:59</strong> |
| :----------: | :---------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------: |
| **TAKE OFF** |                         18/36                         |                         18/36                         |
| **LANDING**  |                         18/36                         |                          36                           |

### Assignment of SSR (Squawk) Codes

All aircraft must be assigned a valid SSR code. In Riga FIR, the following squawk ranges apply:

- **4140 – 4177** for all international flights;[<span className="text-red-500 remove-parent-underline">\*</span>](#unrealistic-ssr-range)
- **0060 – 0077** for all domestic flights (including domestic VFR).

<div
  role="p"
  id="unrealistic-ssr-range"
  className={"_leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:_mt-6"}
>
  <span className="text-red-500">\*</span> The SSR code range used on VATSIM
  differs from the one used in real life due to limitations in the way SSR codes
  are allocated on VATSIM.
</div>

### Flight Plan Validation

All aircraft receiving a departure clearance must have a valid flight plan filed (with an exception for VFR flights as long as their intentions are clearly communicated).

<Callout type="error" emoji="⚠️">
  Regardless of the presence of a flight plan or lack thereof all aircraft must
  have a callsign associated with them and their type must be known.
</Callout>

A flight plan is valid if all of the following conditions are met:

- The route starts with one of the waypoints that a SID leads to.
- The route has a Coordination Point Exit (COPX) with one of the FIRs that neighbour the Riga FIR.
- The route has COPX points on all FIR borders that it passes through.
- The Requested Flight Level (RFL) is appropriate for the direction of flight.

The determination whether the RFL is appropriate for the direction of flight is made using the semicircular rule.

- **EASTBOUND** flights must fly on **ODD** flight levels.
- **WESTBOUND** flights must fly on **EVEN** flight levels.

Designation of odd and even flight levels is sequential up until FL410, thus such FLs as 210, 230, 330, 350, 370, etc. are odd and FLs 220, 280, 320, 340, 360, etc. are even. FL410, however, is the upper limit of RVSM airspace, after which the designation of flight levels happens only every other level, i.e. FL430 is even, FL450 is odd, etc. After FL510, the designation becomes limited to only every 4 levels, therefore, after FL510, the next level is FL550.

### Departure Clearances (IFR)

A departure clearances is the initial clearance an IFR flight receives on first contact with ATC. For the departure clearance to be issued all of the following conditions must be true.

- The pilot must have filed a valid flight plan.
- The requested flight level in the flight plan must be valid for the planned direction of flight.
- The pilot must be aware of the current weather conditions at their departure airport. Awareness of said conditions is determined based on the knowledge of the current ATIS identification letter and local QNH by the pilot.
- The ATCO issuing the clearance must be aware of the aircraft's location and type.

#### Contents of a Departure Clearance

A departure clearance must contain all of the following items in the order given.

1. Standard Instrument Departure.
2. SSR code.

Should the pilot be unable to execute the issued clearance or the pilot's request be that not requiring a Standard Instrument Departure, further departure instruction shall be appended to the end of the departure clearance.

### Pushback and Start-up

A pushback and start-up clearance is needed to authorise initial movement on the apron for a given aircraft and to allow for them to begin maneuvering/taxiing towards the runway-in-use. Such a clearance may only be issued once the aircraft in question has matched their SSR code to the one assigned in the departure clearance.

<Callout type="error" emoji="⚠️">
  Pushback clearances in EVRR FIR are issued **WITHOUT** a direction provided.
</Callout>

There are cases when pushback might not be required for a given aircraft. The following stands do not require pushback.

- 100
- 101
- 103
- 108
- 109
- 112 – 115
- 204 – 208 (for aircraft not larger than DH8D)
- 224 (for aircraft not larger than DH8D)
- 226
- 290 – 292 (LIGHT aircraft only)
- 309
- 311 – 317
- 461 – 462 (LIGHT aircraft only)
- 471 – 479 (LIGHT aircraft only)

The following pushback require a straight pushback due to their proximity to the terminal and other airport infrastructure.

- 102
- 105
- 302
- 303

### Ground Movement

Any movement happening on the ground of a controlled airfield falls under the rules outlined in this section with some overlaps and exceptions for uncontrolled airfields. Control over ground movements is facilitated through the use of taxi clearances and modifying instructions (incl. conditions, give-way instructions, holding instructions, etc.). Generally, all taxi clearances should include the following items:

1. the destination at which the aircraft is expected to hold position;
2. the optimal taxi route;
3. any relevant modifying instructions.

The designated destination of a taxi route can be a holding point (both named and unnamed, i.e. runway holding points), a parking stand, or a de-icing pad. The optimal taxi route is usually, but not always the shortest possible route to the designated destination. Deviations from this may be allowed for sequencing purposes and to apply priority rules.

<Callout type="error" emoji="⚠️">
  All taxi routes must not include the taxiway the aircraft is currently located
  on unless it is standing on taxiway F.
</Callout>

#### Departure Taxi Routes

Departing aircraft should be directed to taxi to one of the holding points adjacent to the runway-in-use. The default holding points are reachable via taxiway A for runway 36 and via taxiway G for runway 18, however, other intersections may be offered to pilots in non-LVP conditions. Below is a table of intersections available at Rīga.

| Runway | Intersection | TORA/TODA (m) |                            Remarks                             |
| :----: | :----------: | :-----------: | :------------------------------------------------------------: |
|   18   |      G       |     3200      |                          Full length                           |
|   18   |      E       |     2609      |        Should be offered to all departures with WTC L/M        |
|   36   |      A       |     3200      |                          Full length                           |
|   36   |      B       |     2509      |        Should be offered to all departures with WTC L/M        |
|   36   |      C       |     2002      |           May be offered to departures with WTC L/M            |
|   36   |      K       |     2003      | Only available from the western side of the airport (apron Z3) |

Although use of the intersections is not limited by wingspan or MTOW, it is fairly uncommon for WTC H traffic to use any intersection other than A or G, therefore pilots of such aircraft need not to be explicitly offered intersection departure opportunities to prevent unnecessary frequency congestion.
